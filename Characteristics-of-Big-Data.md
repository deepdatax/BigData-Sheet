# 5 main characteristics of big data

The characteristics of big data are 5 Vs as shown as follows,

1. **Volume** ⚪ : Volume is the big data dimension that relates to the size of big data. It comes from large datasets, many small data pieces or events over time.
    > B < KB < MB < GB < TB < PB < EB < ZB < YB

    Challenges 🌪:
    
    - Storage
    - Networking, bandwidth, cost
    - Performance

2. **Variety** ✨: It relates to increased diversity.

    - Type variety: Database, image, text, network data, geographic maps
    - Structural variety: refers to the difference in the representation of the data
    - Media variety refers to the medium in which the data gets delivered.
    - Semantic variety: different units for quantities we measure

    Challenges 🌪:

    - Harder to ingest
    - Difficult to create common storage
    - Difficult compare and match data across variety
    - Difficult to integrate
    - Management and policy challenges

3. **Velocity** 🚀: It refers to the increasing speed at which big data is created and the increasing speed at which the data needs to be stored and analyzed. Late decisions means missing opportunities.

4. **Veracity** ✅: It referred to as validity or volatility referring to the lifetime of the data. Veracity is very important for making big data operational, because big data can be noisy and uncertain, it can be full of biases, abnormalities and it can be imprecise.

5. **Value** 💎: The heart of the big data challenge is turning all of the other dimensions into truly useful business value.

# More characteristics
1. **Valence** 🌉: It refers to Connectedness. The more connected data is, the higher it's valences.

    Challenges 🌪:
    - More complex data exploration algorithms 
    - Modeling and prediction of valence changes
    - Group event detection
    - Emergent behavior analysis
